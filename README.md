A JavaScript plugin which moves list items left/right on hover or via the scrollbar.

## Quick start

Simply load and run the script in any app

In the future I will make it fully CJS and AMD compatible


## Features

* Items can be any size and different sizes
* Left/Right Controls are hidden when fully scrolled left/right
* Depends on JQuery and JQuery Debounce Throttle
* supports two layout modes: standard and mobile
* Controls are hidden if the list contents are smaller then the container
